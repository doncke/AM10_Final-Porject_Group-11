# Topic:
This project aims to explore and analyze the factors that influence students' academic performance. Specifically, we will investigate how various social, economic, and behavioral factors correlate with exam scores. By visualizing these relationships, we aim to tell a story about the critical determinants of student success and offer insights into areas where interventions could be most effective.

# Issues and Questions Addressed:
We will address the following questions:
a.	What are the primary factors that correlate with higher exam scores?
b.	How do socio-economic factors (e.g., family income, parental education level) impact student performance?
c.	To what extent do behavioral aspects like hours studied, attendance, and sleep correlate with academic outcomes?
d.	What role does school environment (e.g., teacher quality, peer influence) play in academic success?
e.	Are there differences in performance by gender or access to resources?

# Data Source:
The dataset, titled "StudentPerformanceFactors.csv," contains various factors relevant to students' academic performance, including:
a.	Behavioral factors: Hours studied, attendance, sleep hours, and tutoring sessions.
b.	Socio-economic indicators: Family income, parental involvement, and parental education level.
c.	Environmental aspects: School type, teacher quality, peer influence, and access to resources.
d.	Academic performance indicator: Exam score (dependent variable).

# Statistical Techniques:
To investigate these questions, we plan to use:
a.	Descriptive statistics to summarize and understand the central tendencies and distributions of factors.
b.	Correlation analysis to identify the strength and direction of relationships between exam scores and each factor.
c.	Multiple regression analysis to identify the most impactful predictors of academic performance, considering potential multicollinearity among predictors.
d.	Categorical analysis (e.g., ANOVA) to examine differences in exam scores across categorical variables like school type and parental education level.
e.	Visualization techniques: Scatter plots, box plots, and heatmaps to visualize relationships and categorical effects on exam scores, allowing for an intuitive and impactful data storytelling experience.

# Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, we aim to produce a comprehensive poster that visually communicates key findings on the drivers of student success. Our ultimate goal is to present a project that not only informs but also suggests areas for potential intervention to enhance academic performance.
